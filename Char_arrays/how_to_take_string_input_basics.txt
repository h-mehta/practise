Few important points :

1. cin breaks at new line, tab and space

2. In order to take as input strings that have spaces in them use cin.getline()

		Syntax : 	cin.getline( string_name , length )

		Example:	string str1;
				cin.getline( str1 , 100 )
					      |
					      '----> can now store "Hello world" in str1 !!!

	Important Note:
	
	a. Consider the following code:

					char arr[100]
					cin.getline( arr , 10 );
						     |______|
							'--------> We have told the compiler that my input is 10 chars long
								   But since last character of char array is always null character or '\0'
								   It will store only the first 9 characters in arr and 10th character will be '\0'
	
	
	b. 3rd & optional parameter to cin.getline is the delimiter:
	   By default delimiter is '\n'
		
		Syntax : 	cin.getline( string_name , length , delimiter )

		Example: 	cin.getline( arr , 10 , '$' );	
					      |__________|
					 	   '--------> will take as input 10 characters - 9 from user and 10th as '\0'
							      also if it encounters '$' it will stop before
							      if input is "abcd$efg" ---> arr will store:
												_____________________
												| a | b | c | d | \0 |
												'---'---'---'---'----'
