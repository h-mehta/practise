What kind of problems are solved with DSU :
-   Add elements to same set?
-   Are 2 elements in the same set?

DSU generally implemented using trees.
                                -----

DSU is also called Union-Find -> 2 operations:
- Find : 
    - Each set is represented by candidate node
    - Given a node, find the candidate node this node belongs to?

    For example,
        Let's say 1,2,5 are in same set and candidate node is 2.
        Given node 5 - we have to return what is the candidate node (i.e. 2)

- Union :
    - Given two sets, combine them into same set
    - E.g. 
        Let set 1 be 1,2,5 and set 2 be 3,4
        Union means to combine both sets into one set and assign a single candidate node for the new set

        How is it done?

        Originally:

            Set 1         Set 2

             2              3
            / \             |
           1   5            4

        In set 1, 2 is the candidate node and in set 2, 3 is the candidate node.
        generally the candidate node becomes the root of the tree.

        Thus we can merge in the following way:

             2 ---.              
            / \   |          
           1   5  3
                  |
                  4
        
        Now candidate node is 2 for these nodes
